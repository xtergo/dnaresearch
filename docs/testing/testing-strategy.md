# Testing Strategy

## Testing Philosophy
The DNA Research Platform requires rigorous testing due to the sensitive nature of genomic data and the critical importance of accurate Bayesian calculations.

## Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests (70%)
- Individual function and method testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (<1s per test)
- High code coverage (>90%)

### Integration Tests (20%)
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- External service mocking
- Theory engine workflows

### End-to-End Tests (10%)
- Full user workflows
- Browser automation
- Performance validation
- Security testing

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing
```python
# Example: Theory validation
def test_theory_validation():
    theory = {
        "id": "autism-theory-v1",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "scope": "autism",
        "criteria": {...}
    }
    assert validate_theory_schema(theory) == True
```

### Bayesian Calculation Testing
```python
# Example: Posterior calculation
def test_bayesian_update():
    prior = 0.1
    likelihood = 0.8
    evidence = create_mock_evidence()
    posterior = calculate_posterior(prior, likelihood, evidence)
    assert 0.0 <= posterior <= 1.0
```

### Security Testing
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### Privacy Testing
- Consent verification
- Data anonymization
- Audit trail integrity
- Right-to-be-forgotten compliance

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with genomic datasets
- Memory usage with large VCF files
- Database query optimization
- Cache effectiveness

## Test Data Management

### Synthetic Genomic Data
```python
# Generate test VCF data
def create_synthetic_vcf():
    return """
    ##fileformat=VCFv4.2
    #CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO
    1	100	.	A	T	60	PASS	.
    """
```

### Mock External Services
- Sequencing partner APIs
- Public genomic databases
- Blockchain ledger
- Cloud storage

### Test Case Documentation
```python
def test_theory_bayesian_update():
    """
    Test that Bayesian updates correctly calculate posteriors.

        - A theory with prior probability 0.1
        - Evidence with likelihood ratio 2.0
    When:
        - Bayesian update is performed
    Then:
        - Posterior should be approximately 0.18
        - Confidence interval should be calculated
        - Audit trail should be created
